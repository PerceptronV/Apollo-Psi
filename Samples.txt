Valentine stars
the sound of many curls
in the mirror

summer rain
a long silence
the stone of the full moon

morning fog
the cloud of rain
in the mirror

christmas sits
a drop of a candle
those the sunset

sunset
the sound of rain
drown the shower

another spring
we talk about
the rain

snow shower -
the moon's reflection
in the stone buddha

still smile
full moon
the window

windy day
the first crocus
summer dream

book of haiku -
the paths of winter -
before the stars

first frost
the still rusty rain
in the mist

morning fog
a dragonfly the statue
of a fall game 

first firefly...
a snow flowers
slip path

long winter
an umbrella
crescent moon 

fades of summer
butterfly white flowers
picking bones

long beach
in a silver midnight...
a snail crawls

morning snow...
how the clouds stir
in my coffee
