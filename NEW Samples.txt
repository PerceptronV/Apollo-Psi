the moon's emerged
a child's eyes shaped in a pool
of the subway

cool morning
a tiny insect
the last bones

spring evening
a little stop
a butterfly

spring frost
the call of a full moon
second step

spring cleaning 
a family of rain
another leaf

The sudden heat
crashing the moon
in the sky

summer rain
the clink of the moon
in the sky

between the moon
in the sky and the water
of a butterfly

summer solstice
the still flowers
on my sky

summer rain
the cold morning
a crack in the sky

saturday night
more shadows of
a darkening sky

she dead shadows
for a paged hair
on the line

the sound of rain
a paper lantern day 
a shower of color

pale sunrise
the paper leaf flutters
for a homeless man

evening fog
the barmaid puts the silence
behind the bare store

in the park
the moon petals
for no brailles 

falling leaf
a dollar blossoms
in the sky
